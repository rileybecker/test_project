    <h1 class="title">About</h1>
    <h1 class="subtitle"> <i>Background:</i>
      <h1 class="paragraph">My name is Riley Becker and I am currently in the Career Residency, a program that provides me the opportunity to attend college for a degree and get relevant workplace experience, all while I'm still in high school. Through this program, I attend
        both the University of Colorado Denver and Denver School of Innovation and Sustainable Design. I am currently working on earning my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science while finishing high school. Before becoming interested in the world
        of technology I was very passionate about art and design which I attempt to integrate into my programming. </h1>
      <h1 class="subtitle"><i>Family:</i></h1>
      <h1 class="paragraph">My family, like most, is quite large. I have two younger half-siblings but I consider them regular siblings. Quinton, who just turned 6, is a lot like me; nerdy, smart, and a perfectionist. He's both outgoing and energetic, yet a strict rule follower.
        He's a very serious six year old, even when doing things like coloring in a restaurant. Isadora, or Izzy for short, is a bubbly three year old out there. In her world, Cheez Its are in fact, Cheezy Wheezies, and she can ramble on about Moana incoherently
        for more than an hour. Alongside my half-siblings, we have my step-siblings, Dominic, who's seventeen, and Logan, a nineteen year old Marine. My mom's house contains a puggle, Maizy, and Q, our pug, who is both the shape and intelligence of a
        potato. We also have two cats, Nala and Skippy Jon Jones. At my dad's house we have a greyhound Harriet, who is the opposite of graceful.</h1>
      <h1 class="subtitle"><i>Hobbies:</i></h1>
      <h1 class="paragraph">Travelling is definitely my favorite thing to do. I will go almost anywhere given the chance and will work hard to travel. I go out of state at least once a year and recently have started going out of country. I've visited many other states and
        have traveled to Singapore. I have plans to go to Italy and Greece in 2019. Travelling, however, is expensive, and hard to do, so it's not the only hobby I have. I enjoy hand embroidery, it's something I recently began doing and I find it calming
        and the end product is always incredibly satisfying. I additionally have recently gotten into to video games. I've purchased a great gaming laptop and have begun to play titles such as: Skyrim, Little Nightmares, and Fallout: New Vegas. I've also
        recently gotten a Nintendo Switch which I truly enjoy. That being said, I don't often have the time and space to play games on my laptop so I default to mobile gaming. My favorite mobile titles I have played include: the Cube Escape and Rusty
        Lake series, Inside, and A Dark Room.

    <h1 class="title">What I've Learned so Far</h1>
    <h1 class="paragraph">Learning to code in different languages is something that is not only rewarding to learn, but applicable to the real world. I've been learning to code in HTML, the basis for all websites. As I want a job designing software, I've found it's both, incredibly
      useful and of course fun. Alongside HTML, I've been learned CSS, the language used to style HTML. As someone who really enjoys design and the aesthetics of things, I've found CSS to my favorite thing to learn so far. I like being able to create
      websites that are as close to my preferred design style using what I know. For example, using both HTML and CSS, I can apply Google Fonts to my websites so that I can use fonts such as:
      <ul>
        <li class="font1">Spirax</li>
        <li class="font2">Satisfy</li>
        <li class="font3">Cookie</li>
      </ul>
      I can additionally make text colored through using hexadecimal colors and presets. I prefer hexadecimal colors as it gives you more control. Because of this, I can make colors such as:
      <ul>
        <li class="color1">Plum</li>
        <li class="color2">Pear</li>
        <li class="color3">Peach</li>
      </ul>
    </h1>

    <h1 class="title">Goals</h1>
    <h1 class="paragraph">This program provides many great opportunities and I am so glad to be a part of it. I am hoping to not only finish my Bachelors of Science but to finish it with next to no student loans. I've always dreamed of going to college and getting a degree,
      now that I'm there it's surreal. I'm also hoping to be hired, preferably by the company I'm currently working for. If that doesn't work out, I'd really like to work for a company with a great tech department as my goal.</h1>
